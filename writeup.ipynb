    "# `On the Incorporation of IPythonâ€™s Traitlets into Matplotlib`\n",
    "\n",
    "Traitlets is a package used by IPython to simplify notification and configuration heuristics using pure Python. This is significant for Matplotlib because it provides a way to streamline the callback system, introduce basic type checking that will give useful tracback results, and improve the API by removing classic getter and setter functions in favor of setting or getting attributes directly from an object. On the other hand though, this is important for Traitlets as it's the first time it's been implamented in a large project outside of IPython. Thus, there's been back and forth communication in which changes in one project have influenced those being made in the other."

    "### `+ Notification Muting and Forced Callbacks`\n",
    "\n",
    "Notification muting is used in several locations where updating an instance should alter its model, but not it's state. That is to say that values stored on the instance should be changed (i.e. updating the model), however notifications that would normally be fired as a result should be \"muted\" (i.e. state is maintained). Traitlets has a context manager for \"holding\" notifications, and while inside it, notifications are not triggered, but they are cached, and upon exiting, are fired. Thus, a context manager for \"muting\" has been included. The context manager itself is used explicitely only once or twice, however the method `private` is used extensively. It's found wherever private values on an instance (those named with a prefix of \"`_`\") were accessed or manipulated. The code below demonstrates that using `private` to set a value bypasses both validation and change notifiers, but still updates the value in `_trait_values`."

    "In discussions with IPython devs who are working closely with traitlets, notification \"muting\" has been looked down upon. After all, the point of Traitlets is to trigger notifiers, not mute them. If it's possible, it might be adventageous to alter the functionality of matplotlib such that it wouldn't be needed. I have a feeling that might be a pretty substantial task though. One particularly difficult case comes to mind in which notification \"holding\" is required but notifications must be triggered midway through an inner context.

    "This only occured once during my refactor, but it does so within the contruction of `Subplot` classes which has relatively complex euristics associated with it. To solve the problem posed above I use two methods `mute_trait_notifications` which is a context mannager inspired by `hold_trait_notifications` that halts trait notifications, but still validates. Though notifications are muted, the manager yields a cache of all the changes that it captured before exiting. This makes it possible to force those changes later using `force_notify_changes` which simply uses `private` to set the value, and then calls `_notify_change` to call notifiers.

    "\n",
    "When several attributes are requisite to compute the value of another, a high cost may be imposed to recomputing that value whenever one of its requirements changes. Additionally, if the attributes upon which the value depends exist on several instances (particularly if they're nested), setting up the change handlers that are needed to ensure that updates occur properly creates a lot of complexity. In either of these two cases, computing values at the time they are accessed in a localized function is preferable. For Matplotlib's transform types, though it's difficult to determine whether the former issue is significant enough to consider, the latter is definitely a concern. In the vanilla version of Matplotlib where classic getters and setters are used, getters for transform types returned a computed value that sometimes depended on several others. Now with Traitlets, a `RetrieveHandler` inheriting from `traitlets.EventHandler` is used to replicate this functionality inside a new `TraitType` called `TransformInstance`. A simple example showing how `@retrieve` (a decorator for the handler) can be used to compute values at the time they are accessed:"

As a side project, I worked on an `@requires` decorator which would solve this problem by linking up requisite attributes to a single callback in a relatively simple way. `@requires` was not used in the refactor or Matplotlib, nor was it discussed as a possible inclussion in Traitlets for the future, but it was fun to work on and has some interesting behaviors that are at least somewhat related to the work reported on here.

    "\n",
    "While only a handful of new `TraitTypes` have been required to implament traitlets within the base `Artist` class within matplotlib, there are plenty of opertunities to see them used constructively. Of those used within this refactor, the `TransformInstance` type mentioned above in relation to the computation of value upon retrieval is most significant. However it's purpose is reasonable subtle, a more obvious use for Traitlet's `TraitType` can be seen in the as yet, unused `Color` type. It accepts rgb, rgba, hex, or named colors, and depending on whether the `Color` instance was tagged with \\``as_hex=True`\\` or \\``as_rgb=True`\\` metadata, will coerce values. The examples below show off how `Color` might be used:"

At a very basic level, someone unfamiliar with property-like attributes, or the Traitlets in general, may not expect coersion, or know that an attribute has notifiers associated with it, thus thorough documentation is essential. To combat this, a first attempt at dynamically generating a docstring in `__init__` that describes each `TraitType` on a `HasTraits` instance and its static notifiers was made in PR [`#131`](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/pull/131) against the Traitlets repository. Since all the examples here are meant to be run with the [`master`](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets) branch, what's shown below is the expected output of a use case layed out in [`#131`](https://github.com/ipython/traitlets/pull/131):"

    "Sylvain Corlay proposed the decorator and \"change dicts\" as an alternative to magic methods and lenghty function signatures part way through the refactor process. The decorator uses features of `traitlets.MetaHasTraits` to register notifiers to a `HasTraits` instance without relying on special naming practices like `_<trait_name>_changed`, to identify, and then trigger these functions later. Additionally change dicts (essentially dictionaries filled with key word arguments) make it easy to maintain backward compatability if new key word arguments are needed later. Now a callback function has a consistant signature that accepts one argument (the change dict), whereas before they could take between 1 and 4.\n",

    "`@observe` hasn't changed much since Sylvain proposed it. About the only real change is the added ability to reference the function as a bound or unbound method depending on whether you accessed the `ObserveHandler` through the class or through the instance. It remains important though because it's the inspiration for `@validate` and `@default` which came late, and ultimately Matplotlib's `@retrieve`.

Almost immediately though, it was apparent that the contrast between the magic methods still being used to perform cross-validation and assign default values dynamically and the new decorator was stark. Had `@observe` remained the only decorator in use, it may have added more confusion than it dispelled. To remedy this, the afformetioned decorators were quickly developed."
