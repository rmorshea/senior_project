    "# `Incorporating IPythonâ€™s Traitlets into Matplotlib`\n",
    "\n",
    "Traitlets is a package used by IPython to simplify notification and configuration heuristics using pure Python. This is significant for Matplotlib because it provides a way to streamline the callback system, introduce basic type checking that will give useful tracback results, and improve the API by removing classic getter and setter functions in favor of setting or getting attributes directly. On the other hand though, this is important for Traitlets as it's the first time it's been implamented in a large project outside of IPython. Thus, there's been back and forth communication in which changes in one project have influenced those being made in the other."

    "### `+ Notification Muting and Forced Callbacks`\n",
    "\n",
    "Notification muting is used in several locations where updating an instance should alter its model, but not it's state. That is to say that values stored on the instance should be changed (i.e. updating the model), however notifications that would normally be fired as a result should be \"muted\" (i.e. state is maintained). Traitlets has a context manager for \"holding\" notifications, and while inside it, notifications are not triggered, but they are cached, and upon exiting, are fired. Thus, a context manager for \"muting\" has been included. The context manager itself is used explicitely only once or twice, however the method `private` is used extensively. It's found wherever private values on an instance (those named with a prefix of \"`_`\") were accessed or manipulated. The code below demonstrates that using `private` to set a value bypasses both validation and change notifiers, but still updates the value in `_trait_values`."

    "In discussions with IPython devs who are working closely with traitlets, notification \"muting\" has been looked down upon. After all, the point of Traitlets is to trigger notifiers, not mute them. If it's possible, it might be adventageous to alter the functionality of matplotlib such that it wouldn't be needed. I have a feeling that might be a pretty substantial task though.

To solve the problem posed above I use two methods `mute_trait_notifications` which is a context mannager inspired by `hold_trait_notifications` that halts trait notifications, but still validates. Though notifications are muted, the manager yields a cache of all the changes that it captured before exiting. This makes it possible to force those changes later using `force_notify_changes` which simply uses `private` to set the value, and then calls `_notify_change` to call notifiers.

    "\n",
    "When several attributes are requisite to compute the value of another, a high cost may be imposed to recomputing that value whenever one of its requirements changes. Additionally, if the attributes upon which the value depends exist on several instances (particularly if they're nested), setting up the change handlers that are needed to ensure that updates occur properly creates a lot of complexity. In either of these two cases, computing values at the time they are accessed in a localized function is preferable. For Matplotlib's transform types, though it's difficult to determine whether the former issue is significant enough to consider, the latter is definitely a concern. In the vanilla version of Matplotlib where classic getters and setters are used, getters for transform types returned a computed value that sometimes depended on several others. Now with Traitlets, a `RetrieveHandler` inheriting from `traitlets.EventHandler` is used to replicate this functionality inside a new `TraitType` called `TransformInstance`. A simple example showing how `@retrieve` (a decorator for the handler) can be used to compute values at the time they are accessed:"

Errors are raised when `TraitType.__get__` fails on a `TraitError` and a handler for the trait is absent.

As a side project, I worked on an `@requires` decorator which would solve this problem by linking up requisite attributes to a single callback in a relatively simple way. `@requires` was not used in the refactor or Matplotlib, nor was it discussed as a possible inclussion in Traitlets for the future, but it was fun to work on and has some interesting behaviors that are at least somewhat related to the work reported on here. The following example demonstrates some, but not all of what it can do, as showing everything would take more effort to explain than is worth doing here."

    "While only a handful of new `TraitTypes` have been required to implament traitlets within the base `Artist` class within matplotlib, there are plenty of opertunities to see them used constructively. Of those used within this refactor, the `TransformInstance` type mentioned above in relation to the computation of value upon retrieval is most significant. However it's purpose is reasonable subtle, a more obvious use for Traitlet's `TraitType` can be seen in the as yet, unused `Color` type. It accepts rgb, rgba, hex, or named colors, and depending on whether the `Color` instance was tagged with \\``as_hex=True`\\` or \\``as_rgb=True`\\` metadata, will coerce values.

The decorator uses features of `traitlets.MetaHasTraits` to register notifiers to a `HasTraits` instance without relying on special naming practices like `_<trait_name>_changed`, to identify, and then trigger these functions later. Additionally change dicts (essentially dictionaries filled with key word arguments) make it easy to maintain backward compatability if new key word arguments are needed later. Now a callback function has a consistant signature that accepts one argument (the change dict), whereas before they could take between 1 and 4.\n",

About the only real change is the added ability to reference the function as a bound or unbound method depending on whether you accessed the `ObserveHandler` through the class or through the instance. It remains important though because it's the inspiration for `@validate` and `@default` which came later, and ultimately Matplotlib's `@retrieve`.

For instance, in Matplotlib, there are a slew of attributes that are considered \"properties\" of an artist which ought to trigger a plot to be redrawn. At the moment, all of these attributes use `@observe` to manually call a method within their notifiers which does exactly this for. However it would be much cleaner and apparent to a user that this was the case, if `@observe` could hook into all traits that should have this common callback.

Thus this method is not called prior to the instance being created, but rather afterwards and at the first point where a user needs the value of an attribute without a static default value. The difficulty of implamenting this, is that it is best done as a class based notifier. That is to say, that when a `TraitType` attempts to search for a dynamic default generator which has been registered by `@default`, it should look on the class for this generator, not on the instance which triggered it.

    "+ Note that creating a new generator like this, isn't always gaurenteed to fail (as the output above shows). Instead, failure depends on the order in which the `instance_init` methods of the descriptor `i` and the generator `_i_default_generator` are called - if `_i_default_generator.instance_init` is called first, we will get 1, while if it's `i.instance_init`, we will get 0. Essentially, if the default generator happens to registered before the static default value is set (which cannot be guarenteed) then we get what we expect otherwise, the behavior is inuntuitive. To verify that this is the case, uncomment the print statements in `InstanceDefaultHandler.instance_init` and `MyInt.instance_init` to see the order in which the descriptors were setup."

    "The problems with storing dynamic default generators, as outlined above, motivated these generators to be stored on the class, so that implamenting expected behaviors in derived classes could be accomplished by analyzing the `mro` of a class to determine whether or not a dynamic default generator should, or should not be used in place of staticly defined default values. Ultimately this motivated the inclusion of three new methods: `HasTraits.setup_instance`, `HasDescriptors.setup_class`, and `BaseDescriptor.class_init` which are dedicated to creating an intuitive implamentation."
